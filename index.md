## 🚀 DevOps Projects

### **Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure Orchestration**
**Stack:** `AWS` `GCP` `Terraform` `Ansible`
* Designed a multi-cloud environment orchestrating worker nodes on both AWS EC2 and GCP Compute Engine using a centralized control node.
* Developed modular Terraform scripts to provision VPCs, Subnets, and Instances with S3 backend and DynamoDB state locking.
* Automated the "bootstrap" phase using Ansible playbooks, reducing provisioning time by **80%**.
* Configured granular Security Groups and Firewall rules for secure cross-cloud communication.

### **Automated Container Deployment**
**Stack:** `Docker` `Ansible` `Python Flask` `Gunicorn`
* Containerized a Python Flask web application using Docker to eliminate environment/OS mismatch issues.
* Automated the end-to-end deployment pipeline using Ansible playbooks to provision servers and deploy containers without intervention.
* Configured Gunicorn as a production-grade WSGI server for high availability.
* Implemented IaC principles to version-control server configs, reducing deployment time by **40%**.

### **Multi-Tier Microservices Orchestration**
**Stack:** `Kubernetes` `Helm` `Splunk` `Kafka`
* Architected a unified Helm Chart to orchestrate a hybrid workload (Nginx, Kafka, Splunk).
* Implemented auto-scaling (**HPA**) for Nginx pods based on custom packets-per-second metrics.
* Engineered high-availability storage using **StatefulSets** and `volumeClaimTemplates` for Kafka.
* Deployed node-level observability using **DaemonSets** for Splunk Universal Forwarder.
